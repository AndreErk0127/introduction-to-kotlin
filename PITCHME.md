## Classes

---

### Exercise

Create the classes *Square* and *Triangle* which inherit from *Shape* taking into account:

1. Shapes have base and height, which never change, and beauty, which does change
2. We need a method that calculates the area of a shape
3. We need tests!

### What have we learned?

@ul
- Constructors, getters and setters are given to us *for free*
- Kotlin prefers default values over method overloading
- Simple methods can be written in one line
- Kotlin dependencies simplify dependency management
