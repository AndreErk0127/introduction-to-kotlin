# Introduction to Kotlin Workshop

This repository contains the material for a workshop whose aim is to showcase some of the features
that Kotlin provides. It is meant to be suitable for developers who have never worked with Kotlin
before, although being familiar with other object oriented languages could be helpful.

**Note that I haven't finished working on this workshop yet, so it might not be ready to be re-used
yet.**

## Presentation

that is meant to be provided by the trainer. They can be found
